# Handwritten digit recognition 
Handwritten digit recognition, using a very basic neural network

# Note:
- Using library Eigen 3.4.0.
- For reading image input, I wrote my Image class that support 8-bit and 24-bt bitmap file, and convert the image to gray scale.
- For testing, using paint and open the image in /test/test.bmp, redraw the image and then hit enter key.
- To exit test loop, type "exit" and hit enter.
- For easy while using paint, the setInvert() take True value. For the image is the same as type as training data, clear invert flag.
